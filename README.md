# Overview

This project uses arcade to recreate the classic game of simon says. It has the typical visual of blinking red, blue, yellow, and green and takes user inputs. There are a total of four classes making four windows. One for start, one for the main game, one for every time a new level is about to start, and one for when the game ends. This project was a great combination of visual programming and logic

# Future Work

Some things I would like to improve in the future
* I would like the squares to blink or something to indicate the user has clicked on it
* I would like to improve a few minor visual things
* I would like to find a way for simon to blink so it can show the same color twice in a row
